# Cplusplus-Score-The-Race
Input the outcomes of a race by using capital letters, then the program will crunch some numbers and spit back a few statistics.
// For this race program, please enter a string input of CAPITAL LETTERS. Each letter will represents one race participant, 
// and the order of the letters you enter will represent what each racer placed at the end. For example, if you enter ABC, 
// player A got first place, player B got 2nd place, and C got 3rd. ALSO, teams are allowed, but only if the number of players 
// per team are equal. In this case, team averages will determine the winner. " << endl << endl << "If my description was too 
// confusing, try entering ABCABC - once you observe the results, it should become clear. If you're finished entering races, 
// simply type done (in lowercase letters).
